title: "Ergodicity and Education"
description: "Most of the times, we compare individuals and compute averages to understand behaviours and relationships between different facets of lives. But, what if we value individualities more than averages? I am currently exploring the concept of ergodicity to understand more about intraindividual variabilities and its relations to education."

The concept of ergodicity dates further back to Boltzmann by his works in thermodynamics and statistical physics, which then evolves to serve as a fundamental concept in dynamical system. Dynamical system itself aims to study the behavior of $T^n(x)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty,$ where $T$ is a function defined on a set $X$ and $T^n$ is just an iteration of applying $T$ to $X, n$ times. The mathematical foundation for this has been provided by George D. Birkhoff on his seminal paper <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.17.2.656" class="text-pink-500 hover:text-indigo-500">"Proof of Ergodic Theorem"</a>.
